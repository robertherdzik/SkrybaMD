ðŸŽ³ We should take care of these things still ;)

- [x] handle as a input of the script name of the Output file
- [x] create redable README.md file, with installation, how to use, ect...
- [ ] clean up code, move to separate files, change into classes/structures
- [x] create .md anchors from table of content to particular documentation place (see: https://gist.github.com/asabaylus/3071099#file-gistfile1-md)
- [ ] Handle special characters in the Table of Content titles like e.g.: `, ~ ... now probably some of them will break linking mechanism
- [ ] Add "Do not edit directly .md file" footer
- [ ] Unit Tests
